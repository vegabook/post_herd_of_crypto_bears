Code to recreate the chart from this [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7017956554112917504?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Install R, `source("main.r")` in the root directory of the repo. It'll tell you a bunch of times that it can't find some library. Simply `install.packages(x)` for each one of those libraries until they're all installed, and the chart will magically pop up.
